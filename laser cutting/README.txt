I started off with pentagons and edges with 59mm side length.
But later discovered that the edges were 1mm short in order to fit the LED strips
So length became 60mm for both the pentagons and the dodecahedron edges (although the edges are measured differently and have '57mm' as their length)

Note on opening .svg files
When opening in inkscape, often the paths/lines are not shown because the default line width is simply too small.
Do:
-Select all (ctrl-A)
-go to 'Stroke Style'
-increase the width to 0.2mm
-if needed, choose a different color
